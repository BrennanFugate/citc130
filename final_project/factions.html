            <h1 style="color: #dc9a20; font-size: xx-large; font-weight:200;">The Imperium of Man</h1>
            <p>A vast, crumbling galactic empire consisting of countless human worlds. The Imperium is authoritarian and fanatically religious, ruled by the immortal Emperor of Mankind, who is kept alive in a near-death state on the Golden Throne. It includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Space Marines: Genetically enhanced super-soldiers, serving as humanity's elite warriors. Divided into chapters, each with its own culture and combat style.</li>
                <li>Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard): The backbone of the Imperium’s military, consisting of regular human soldiers. They rely on numbers, tanks, and artillery to overwhelm enemies.</li>
                <li>Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle): Zealous warriors of the Ecclesiarchy, the church of the Imperium. They are known for their faith-driven miracles and dedication to purging heresy.</li>
                <li>Adeptus Mechanicus: Tech-priests and soldiers from Mars who worship the Machine God. They field advanced weaponry and worship technology as sacred.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 style="color:#dc9a20 ; font-size: xx-large; font-weight:200;">Chaos</h1>
            <p>The twisted servants of the Chaos Gods, entities of pure malice from the Warp.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chaos Space Marines: Former Space Marines who betrayed the Imperium and now serve the Chaos Gods. They seek vengeance against their loyalist brethren.</li>
                <li>Daemons of Chaos: Demonic entities serving one of the four Chaos Gods—Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, or Slaanesh. Each daemon embodies aspects of their patron's nature.</li>

                 <p>Various alien species with their own ambitions, often clashing with the Imperium and each other.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aeldari (Eldar): An ancient and dwindling race of highly advanced aliens. They are psychic and seek to avoid their inevitable extinction. The Aeldari consist of Craftworld Aeldari, who are more traditional, and the Drukhari (Dark Eldar), who live by raiding and inflicting pain.</li>
                <li>Necrons: Once a race of flesh and blood, the Necrons are now soulless robotic warriors that have awakened after millions of years. They seek to reclaim the galaxy from the younger species.</li>
                <li>T'au Empire: A young and ambitious faction, striving for their philosophy known as the "Greater Good." They are technologically advanced, using battlesuits and powerful weaponry to fight their enemies.</li>
                <li>Tyranids: A ravenous swarm of alien organisms seeking to consume all biomass. They are a biological force of nature, evolving to adapt and overwhelm any foe in their path.</li>
                <li>Genestealer Cults: Hybrid followers of the Tyranids, these cults infiltrate human worlds, preparing them for eventual consumption by the Tyranid Hive Fleet.</li>
                <li>Leagues of Votann: Known as the "Kin," these are a reimagining of the old Squat faction. The Leagues are descendants of human colonists from the ancient past, now operating as resource-focused miners and traders. They are fiercely protective of their kinships and wield powerful weapons and technology.</li>
            </ul>
