    <h1> The Minis </h1>
    <p style="color:#7a1a1a; font-size: large;">In Warhammer 40,000, miniatures (commonly called "minis") represent the various soldiers, vehicles, and creatures that make up the different factions in the galaxy. These minis are key elements of the game, brought to life through assembly, customization, and painting. Each miniature is made from plastic or resin and is meticulously detailed, reflecting the characteristics of its faction.

        The miniatures in Warhammer 40k are divided into different unit types:

    <ul style="color: #7a1a1a; font-size: large;">

        <li>Infantry: Foot soldiers make up the core of most armies. They vary greatly depending on the faction, from Space Marine squads in their heavy power armor to the endless tides of Tyranid gaunts or Astra Militarum guardsmen. Infantry are versatile units, often focused on objectives, providing fire support, or engaging in melee combat.</li>
        <li>Elites: These are specialized units, generally more powerful and durable than standard infantry. Examples include Space Marine Terminators in their thick armor or Ork Nobz. Elites have unique skills and weapons that make them formidable in battle.</li>
        <li>HQ Units: These are the leaders and commanders of your army, representing characters of significant importance in the lore. HQ units often provide special abilities or buffs to surrounding troops. Examples include Chapter Masters for Space Marines or Chaos Lords for Chaos Space Marines.</li>
        <li>Vehicles and Walkers: Vehicles range from light transports to heavy tanks like the Astra Militarumâ€™s Leman Russ. Walkers, such as the Space Marine Dreadnoughts, are mechanized units with powerful weaponry. They provide heavy fire support and can help break through enemy lines.</li>
        <li>Monsters: Representing massive biological units, these are found in factions like the Tyranids or Chaos Daemons. They can be terrifying in close combat and can often withstand heavy fire.</li>
        <li>Flyers: Aircraft and aerial units are available to many factions. They provide fast movement across the battlefield and have the capability to deliver devastating firepower. Examples include the Space Marine Stormtalon or the Necron Doom Scythe.</li>
        <li>Fast Attack: These units are designed for speed and mobility, often used to flank the enemy or seize objectives. Examples include Space Marine Assault Bikes or the Eldar Windriders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color: #7a1a1a;">
        Each miniature unit plays a unique role on the battlefield, and collecting them involves both tactical decisions for gameplay and personal aesthetic preferences. Players assemble and paint these models, adding their own creative flair, which is an integral part of the hobby.
