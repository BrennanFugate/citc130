        <h1>So... what is the actual game?</h1>
    <p style="color: #701212; font-size: large;">
    Warhammer 40,000 (commonly called Warhammer 40k) is a tabletop miniature wargame set in a dystopian, far-future universe, 
    developed by Games Workshop. Players command armies of intricately detailed miniatures, 
    representing different factions from the dark and war-torn galaxy of the 41st millennium. The game combines strategic planning, 
    tactical skill, and creative hobby aspects, including painting and customizing your own models.
    At its core, Warhammer 40k is about assembling your forces, placing them on a battlefield,
    and engaging in turn-based combat with an opponent. Players take turns moving their units, rolling dice to resolve attacks, 
    and using special abilities to gain the upper hand. Armies range from the genetically modified warriors of the Imperium of Man,
    like the iconic Space Marines, to monstrous Tyranids, the enigmatic Aeldari, or the brutal Orks. Each faction has its own lore,
    play style, strengths, and weaknesses, providing endless possibilities for strategy and customization.
    The game is played on a board covered with terrain to simulate futuristic battlefields, from bombed-out ruins to alien landscapes.
    Players decide on the mission objectives, army sizes, and battlefield rules, 
    creating a unique story-driven experience each time they play. 
    The outcome of battles is influenced not only by the tactics employed but also by the luck of dice rolls,
    making it a blend of skill and chance.
    Warhammer 40k isn't just about gameplay—it's also a deeply immersive hobby. 
    Players spend time assembling and painting their miniatures, 
    creating armies that are as visually striking as they are strategically powerful. The blend of lore-rich storytelling, 
    competitive gameplay, and artistic creativity makes Warhammer 40k a unique and engaging experience,
    attracting fans from around the world for more than 30 years. Below you will find a

    <h3 style="text-shadow: .4px .4px .4px;"> A Forewarning: Here Be (Financial) Monsters  </h3>
    <p style="color: #701212; font-size: large;">
        Despite this lustrous career, Warhammer is rightly tagged as a money sink, with one of the most common responses to it's pricetag being "well at least I'm not addicted to meth."
        Which is not an argument without merit, but a defining factor of a hobby being an investment most similar to drug addiction doesn't make ot seem the most appealing. 
        Normal 40k requires a minimum of about $500 for the cheapest army, but that's not all. You'll need to buy the rules seperately, painting supplies (see the minis section), terrain for your battles, and room to host them if you don't want to transport your entire army to a game store. So, if this seems overwhelming but you want to play SOMETHING in the universe, then may I introduce Kill Team?

    <h3 style="text-shadow: .4px .4px .4px;"> Warhammer 40K: Kill Team</h3>
        <p style="color: #701212; font-size: large;"> Do you want thematic resonance with the grim darkness of the far future? Do you want to get attached to your invidual squad members? 
            Do you want to not be forced to pick up a third job or sell an ancillary organ to put together a fake little plastic army you're hyperfixating over? Kill Team fills that gap between the rich and poor, while still allowing overlap as minis from Kill Team can be utilized in 40k. 
            Warhammer 40K: Kill Team offers a more financially accessible entry into the Warhammer universe compared to traditional Warhammer 40k, primarily because it requires fewer models, reducing the initial cost of purchasing miniatures, hobby supplies, and paint. While a full 40k army can cost hundreds of dollars, a Kill Team requires only one or two squad boxes, making it far less expensive. Additionally, the smaller scale of Kill Team means fewer terrain pieces are needed, and the rulebooks and expansions are more streamlined and affordable. The game’s simplicity also provides a lower barrier to entry for new players, as they can learn and enjoy the game without a massive financial or time commitment. This makes Kill Team ideal for players who want a taste of Warhammer’s tactical depth without the investment required for a full-scale army, allowing them to participate in skirmishes and competitive play at a fraction of the cost.
