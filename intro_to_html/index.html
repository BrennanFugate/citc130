        <h1> Sci-Fi Aesthetics Make Fantasy Aesthetics Look Goofy</h1>

            <h5> A real-time changing of opinion by me</h5>

        <p> I am enraptured by stories, specifically stories that take place in worlds or universes that are not our own. When it comes to fiction, there is consistent contention between sci-fi and fantasy. I have recently been on a hunt to watch all of the great Sci-Fi movies and have become absolutely enraptured by how the vibes of these movies are made INSTANTLY recognizable by their aesthetics. The original Alien's visual design was born from the mind of HR Giger, a Swedish artist whose art is admittedly too risque for a school project but is known for being the very definition of what should come to mind when you see the word "biomechanical". 
            Which one is better? Is all magic science that just hasn't been discovered yet? Is a jedi just a wizard? Blah blah blah, who cares. 
            Here's my point: Sci-Fi's aesthetics are unmatched. Let me put you on to these.</p>

       <p> All of you Tolkien nerds can SHUT UP, and if you're thinking "But aren't some of your examples Sci-Fantasy?" I ask you something very simple. Which part of that combination is mentioned FIRST?
        Also, think about the composition of the outfits. Yeah, your stereotypically coquettish bard may the finest tabbard in all the land, but my Space Boyfriend has on intergalactic silk. Do you know how good a silk has to be for there to be an array of planets offering their own spin on a fabric and you choose a specific one? It's like the difference between the best gumbo in New Orleans and the best gumbo in Burlington, Vermont. One is forged by the infernal heat of competition while the other skates by on novelty.

        <h2> After Some Thought, I May Be Wrong </h2>
        <p>
            I've done alot of digging in hopes of settling my mind about this topic (Links posted below), and with heapings of self reflection I've realized that it's okay to admit there are great aesthetics of both fantasy and sci-ff. I've listed some fantastic fantasy aesthetics below with links, but I believe I've found an answer to this conundrum.
