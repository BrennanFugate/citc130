        <h1> Sci-Fi Aesthetics Make Fantasy Aesthetics Look Goofy</h1>

            <h5> A real-time changing of opinion by me</h5>
        <p> I am enraptured by stories, specifically stories that take place in worlds or universes that are not our own. When it comes to fiction, there is consistent contention between sci-fi and fantasy: 
            Which one is better? Is all magic science that just hasn't been discovered yet? Is a jedi just a wizard? Blah blah blah, who cares. Here's my point: Sci-Fi's aesthetics are unmatched. Let me put you on to this. 
        Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars (Specifically the original trilogy), Warhammer, Halo, Destiny, Star Trek, Dune, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Annihilation. All of you Tolkien nerds can SHUT UP, and if you're thinking "But aren't some of your examples Sci-Fantasy?" I ask you something very simple. Which part of that combination is mentioned FIRST?
        Also, think about the 'fits. Yeah, your stereotypically risque bard may have leather and a tabbard on but my Space Boyfriend has on
